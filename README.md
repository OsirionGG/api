# osirion public api
> the api for fortnite match data ðŸ’š

the osirion public api makes it easy to access match data from uploaded client replays and server replays (tournament matches), without needing an up-to-date parser of your own.

## prerequisites

to use the api, you need to:

- create an osirion account on [our website](https://osirion.gg)
- generate an api key under [account settings](https://osirion.gg/app/settings)
- load up on some api credits under [account settings](https://osirion.gg/app/settings)

once done, you can use the api via REST endpoints or via the [``@osirion/api`` npm package (for JS/TS)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@osirion/api).

each api call costs credits, and 1000 credits is about equal to â‚¬1.

- uploading replays costs 20 credits (~â‚¬0.02).
- every other api call costs 1 credit (~â‚¬0.001).

note that this is subject to change as we develop the api further.


## docs and endpoints

for now, you can find endpoints in this [Postman collection](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/23177710/2s9YeHarB1).
